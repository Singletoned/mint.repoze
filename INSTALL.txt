This application is built on top of repoze.bfg which is not available from PyPI.

So within a virtualenv, lets install the base packages:
    
    $ easy_install -i http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/simple repoze.bfg
    $ easy_install -i http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/simple repoze.bfg.convention
    $ easy_install -i http://dist.repoze.org/lemonade/dev/simple repoze.bfg.jinja2
    
(If you have any problems installing these packages, check out http://static.repoze.org/bfgdocs/narr/install.html)
(we will try and provide a buildout script in future)

When these are installed you should be able to install the rest of this packages dependencies as usual through setuptools:

    $ python setup.py install
    OR
    $ python setup.py develop

then test the application to make sure it works:

    $ nosetests
    OR
    $ python setup.py test

enjoy!
